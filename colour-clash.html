        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Color Clash is a dynamic two-player reaction speed game prototype designed to test and enhance participants' hand-eye coordination through interactive gameplay. The game challenges players to swiftly match colors by pressing corresponding buttons. The prototype integrates user-centered design principles and iterative development processes to optimize usability and gameplay experience.

        <h2>User Testing and Iteration</h2>
        <h3>Key Insights</h3>
        <p>
            I conducted comprehensive user research through playtesting sessions and documented the following key insights:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Color Distinction Issues:</b> Users found it challenging to differentiate between cyan and blue on the keypads.</li>
                <li><b>Terminology Confusion:</b> Some users were unfamiliar with the term "magenta" and suggested renaming it to "purple."</li>
                <li><b>Ergonomic Preferences:</b> Feedback indicated a preference for holding the keypads separately rather than having them fixed on the board.</li>
                <li><b>Screen Size Concerns:</b> Several users felt the LCD display was too small.</li>
                <li><b>Game Balance:</b> The existing point deduction system created a negative feedback loop for losing players. Users suggested introducing a streak system to balance the gameplay.</li>
                <li><b>Sound Feedback:</b> The sounds for correct and incorrect inputs were indistinguishable and perceived as distracting.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Implemented Changes</h3>
        <p>
            Based on the user feedback, our team made several iterations to improve the game:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Display Pattern Standardization:</b> We standardized the Neotrellis board display to ensure a fair distribution of colors for both players.</li>
                <li><b>Keypad Design:</b> Redesigned keypads to be held separately in each hand, enhancing user comfort and versatility.</li>
                <li><b>Color Adjustments:</b> Changed cyan to orange for better visibility and renamed "magenta" to "purple."</li>
                <li><b>Combo System:</b> Implemented a combo streak system that rewards consecutive correct answers, making the game more balanced and competitive.</li>
                <li><b>Sound Feedback:</b> Modified buzzer sounds to clearly differentiate between correct and incorrect inputs.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </section>
       <section>
        <h2>Final Outcome and Further Improvements</h2>
            <p>
                The final prototype incorporated these changes, resulting in a more engaging and user-friendly game. Key features included:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Neotrellis Boards:</b> Attached to 3D casings with hidden wires, power supply, and buzzer.</li>
                    <li><b>LCD Screen:</b> Centrally placed to display scores and colors.</li>
                    <li><b>Ergonomic Keypads:</b> Players can hold the color boards, enabling two-handed play.</li>
                    <li><b>Distinctive Colors:</b> Seven easily distinguishable colors (red, green, orange, yellow, purple, blue, white) were used.</li>
                    <li><b>Enhanced Sound Feedback:</b> Clear audio signals for correct and incorrect inputs.</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Future Directions</h3>
            <p>Looking ahead, several avenues for further improvement and expansion of Color Clash include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiplayer Functionality: <p>Introducing support for more than two players to enhance social play and accommodate larger groups.</p></li>
                <li>Customization Options <p>Offering adjustable difficulty levels and gameplay modes to cater to players of varying skill levels and preferences.</p></li>
                <li>Enhanced Feedback Mechanisms <p>Continuing to refine sound and visual cues to provide clearer and more intuitive feedback during gameplay.</p></li>
            </ul>
