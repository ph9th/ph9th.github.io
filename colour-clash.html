                        <p>
                            Color Clash is a dynamic two-player reaction speed game prototype designed to test and
                            enhance
                            participants' hand-eye coordination through interactive gameplay. The game challenges
                            players to
                            swiftly match colors by pressing corresponding buttons. The prototype integrates
                            user-centered
                            design principles and iterative development processes to optimize usability and gameplay
                            experience.

                        <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                        <p>During the development of Color Clash, various prototyping methods were employed to iterate
                            and
                            refine the game concept. This included rapid prototyping with basic materials like cardboard
                            to
                            test initial gameplay mechanics and interaction dynamics.

                        <h2>User Testing and Iteration</h2>
                        <h3>Key Insights</h3>
                        <p>
                          I conducted comprehensive user research through playtesting sessions and documented the following key insights:
                        <ul>
                          <li><span>Color Distinction Issues</span> – Users found it challenging to differentiate between cyan and blue on the keypads.</li>
                          <li><span>Terminology Confusion</span> – Some users were unfamiliar with the term "magenta" and suggested renaming it to "purple."</li>
                          <li><span>Ergonomic Preferences</span> – Feedback indicated a preference for holding the keypads separately rather than having them fixed on the board.</li>
                          <li><span>Screen Size Concerns</span> – Several users felt the LCD display was too small.</li>
                          <li><span>Game Balance</span> – The existing point deduction system created a negative feedback loop for losing players. Users suggested introducing a streak system to balance the gameplay.</li>
                          <li><span>Sound Feedback</span> – The sounds for correct and incorrect inputs were indistinguishable and perceived as distracting.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <h3>Implemented Changes</h3>
                        <p>
                          Based on the user feedback, our team made several iterations to improve the game:
                        <ul>
                          <li><span>Display Pattern Standardization</span> – We standardized the Neotrellis board display to ensure a fair distribution of colors for both players.</li>
                          <li><span>Keypad Design</span> – Redesigned keypads to be held separately in each hand, enhancing user comfort and versatility.</li>
                          <li><span>Color Adjustments</span> – Changed cyan to orange for better visibility and renamed "magenta" to "purple."</li>
                          <li><span>Combo System</span> – Implemented a combo streak system that rewards consecutive correct answers, making the game more balanced and competitive.</li>
                          <li><span>Sound Feedback</span> – Modified buzzer sounds to clearly differentiate between correct and incorrect inputs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                      </section>
                      <section id="final">
                        <h2>Final Outcome and Further Improvements</h2>
                        <p>
                          The final prototype incorporated these changes, resulting in a more engaging and user-friendly game. Key features included:
                        <ul>
                          <li><span>Neotrellis Boards</span> – Attached to 3D casings with hidden wires, power supply, and buzzer.</li>
                          <li><span>LCD Screen</span> – Centrally placed to display scores and colors.</li>
                          <li><span>Ergonomic Keypads</span> – Players can hold the color boards, enabling two-handed play.</li>
                          <li><span>Distinctive Colors</span> – Seven easily distinguishable colors (red, green, orange, yellow, purple, blue, white) were used.</li>
                          <li><span>Enhanced Sound Feedback</span> – Clear audio signals for correct and incorrect inputs.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <p>Looking ahead, several avenues for further improvement and expansion of Color Clash include:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><span>Multiplayer Functionality</span> – Introducing support for more than two players to enhance social play and accommodate larger groups.</li>
                          <li><span>Customization Options</span> – Offering adjustable difficulty levels and gameplay modes to cater to players of varying skill levels and preferences.</li>
                          <li><span>Enhanced Feedback Mechanisms</span> – Continuing to refine sound and visual cues to provide clearer and more intuitive feedback during gameplay.</li>
                        </ul>
